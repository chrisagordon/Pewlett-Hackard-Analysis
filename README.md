## 1. OVERVIEW OF THE ANALYSIS
* At Pewlett-Hackard there is an upcoming wave of retiring individuals among the workforce. In order to get ahead of this we have been asked by staff to compile lists from a database who is retiring and from what positions in order to a mentorship program in action to train their replacements before they depart from the company.
